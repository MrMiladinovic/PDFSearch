- **Progress Tracking**: View the progress of the search operation with a progress bar.
- **Results Display**: See the filenames, file paths, and pages where the keyword was found.
- **Save Results**: Save the search results to a CSV file with the search query included in the filename.
- **Context Menu**: Right-click to copy the file path of the search results.
